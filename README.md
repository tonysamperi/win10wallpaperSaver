# Introduction

One of the features of Windows 10 I like, is the chance to have dynamic wallpapers when locking the screen.
But, ouch! I liked that one so much...It's unlikely that Windows will show me that again!
This time I was lucky, I found the image on the web...but...next time?

No problem! There's **Win10WallpaperSaver** now!

# Requirements

The repo contains 2 versions of the script.
I made the original version to save only images with 1920x1080 resolution, because Windows will save full images and clipped images.

That version requires a software called "Image Magick", that you can download <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php">here</a>.

There is also a "deps-free" version of the script, which will save each image **over 768000 bytes**

# Usage

Simply double click the BAT file.
A "Assets" folder will be created on your desktop!
